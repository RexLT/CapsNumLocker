# CapsNumLocker
This app adds an icon to the System Tray to show the status of Caps Lock &amp; Num Lock

This is a Visual Basic application designed to fill a need when on a remote server and sometimes the keyboard is out-of-sync for caps and number locks.

The icon is designed to show the current status of the caps lock and num lock keys so that you are do not have to rely on the keyboard.  It takes the form of a red C if the caps lock is off or a green C if the caps lock is on.  Same for the number lock but using a red or green N.
